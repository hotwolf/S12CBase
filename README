S12CBase
======== 
S12CBase is a general purpose application library for Freescale's S12(X) 
microcontroller families, writen in assembly language. 
This library has initially been written for the OpenBDC project 
(https://github.com/hotwolf/OpenBDC) using a MC9S12C128 MCU. The following 
hardware ports have been added since:

           - AriCalculator     (https://github.com/hotwolf/AriCalculator)
	   - BEPM              (https://github.com/Hocus-Pocus/BEPM)
	   - FreeEMS	       (http://freeems.org)
	   - MagniCube         (https://github.com/hotwolf/MagniCube)
	   - Mini-BDM-Pod      (https://github.com/hotwolf/Mini-BDM-Pod)
	     & LFBDMPGMR       (S08/S12 programmer by Freescale)
           - OpenBDC           (https://github.com/hotwolf/OpenBDC)
	   - S12DP256-Mini-EVB (plain MC9HCS12DP256 evaluation board)
	   - S12G-Micro-EVB    (https://github.com/hotwolf/S12G-Micro-EVB)
           - SIMCH12           (http://www.hcs12text.com/freesim.html)
